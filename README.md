# EntitySeg Toolbox: Towards open-world and high-quality image segmentation

EntitySeg is an open source toolbox which towards open-world and high-quality image segmentation. All works related to image segmentation from our group are open-sourced here.

To date, EntitySeg implements the following algorithms:

* [Open-World Entity Segmentation (TPAMI2022)](Entity/README.md) --- _released_ 
* [High Quality Segmentation for Ultra High-resolution Images (CVPR2022)](High-Quality-Segmention/README.md) --- _released_
* [CA-SSL: Class-Agnostic Semi-Supervised Learning for Detection and Segmentation (ECCV2022)]() ---  _released_
* [High-Quality Entity Segmentation (ICCV2023 Oral)](Entityv2/README.md) ---  _released_
* [Rethinking Evaluation Metrics of Open-Vocabulary Segmentaion](Open-Metrics/README.md) --- _released_
* [AIMS: All-Inclusive Multi-Level Segmentation (NeurlPS2023 Spotlight)]() -- code to be released
* [UniGS: Unified Representation for Image Generation and Segmentation (Arxiv)]() -- code to be released
  


## Usage

Please refer to the README.md of each project. All projects would be merged to support each other in the soon.
