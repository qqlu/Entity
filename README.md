# EntitySeg Toolbox: Towards open-world and high-quality image segmentation

EntitySeg is an open source toolbox which towards open-world and high-quality image segmentation. All works related to image segmentation from our group are open-sourced here.

To date, EntitySeg implements the following algorthms:

* [Open-World Entity Segmentation (arXiv)](Entity/README.md) --- _released_ 
* [High Quality Segmentation for Ultra High-resolution Images (CVPR2022)](High-Quality-Segmention/README.md) --- _released_
* [CA-SSL: Class-Agnostic Semi-Supervised Learning for Detection and Segmentation (ECCV2022)]() --- _code to be released_
* [Automatically Discovering Novel Visual Categories with Adaptive Prototype Learning]() --- _code to be released_


## Usage

Please refer to the README.md of each project. All projects would be merged to support each other in the soon.
